1. Read the Twitch command document
https://help.twitch.tv/customer/en/portal/articles/659095-chat-commands#AllMods
 
2. Read the Twitch ToS and Community Guidelines
https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-service/
https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/
https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/faq/

3. Have Google Translate and Urban Dictionary open in separate tabs/windows
https://translate.google.com
https://urbandictionary.com
 
4. Learn the commands for the channel bot, within reason
 
5. Basic mod stuff:
* Timeout users by typing the name if it's hard to click unless they're using homographs in their name (e.g. using I L 1 l, such as tr011er)
* Purge comments with a 1 second timeout
* Don't troll back
* Enforce, in order: US federal speech laws that can get Twitch in legal trouble (Twitch is a US company), Twitch ToS and Community Guidelines, channel rules set by the streamer (written down or not), then use common sense
* Ban anyone for making death threats, SWATting threats, rape threats, etc. and report to Twitch.  Click on their name, drag the pop-up window a bit to the left, and you'll see three dots.  Click that, and you can report the user.
* For slow chats, you can click on the name and use the timeout and ban buttons.  For faster chats, type if possible.
* When chat gets too fast *during a spam attack*, turn on slow mode and r9kmode to purge/timeout/ban.  Enable 1 minute (or more) followers-only mode.
* Make a new Twitch account that does not follow or subscribe to any channels.  Use that for testing on your own channel to learn how to use commands.
* Don't argue with the streamer.
* You can unmod yourself with /unmod yourusername

6. Intermediate mod stuff:
* Unignore everyone.  Trolls that you ignore are ones you can't time out or ban.  Use https://twitchstuff.3v.fi/ignored/ to find out who you've ignored.
* If you are getting too many whispers, you can go to https://www.twitch.tv/settings/security and enable "Block Whispers from Strangers".  You will only get a whisper from someone you follow.  Note, this does mean you will miss important messages, as well.  Consider the downsides before enabling this.
* Mods generally have access to the streamer's automod dashboard: https://www.twitch.tv/<streamername>/dashboard/settings/automod  Use that dashboard to modify permitted and denied phrases to deal with common spam and terms.  Sorry, no regex support.
