1. Read the Twitch command document
https://help.twitch.tv/customer/en/portal/articles/659095-chat-commands#AllMods
 
2. Read the Twitch ToS and Community Guidelines
https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-service/
https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/
https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/faq/
https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/harassment/
 
3. Have Google Translate and Urban Dictionary open in separate tabs/windows
https://translate.google.com
https://urbandictionary.com
 
4. Learn the commands for the channel bot, within reason
 
5. Basic mod stuff:
* Timeout users by typing the name if it's hard to click unless they're
  using homographs in their name (e.g. using I L 1 l, such as tr011er).
* For hard to type names, click their names.  Then use the ban/timeout
  buttons in the pop-up.  Don't use mod icons directly in chat as it can
  scroll and hit the wrong person.
* Purge comments with a 1 second timeout.
* Don't troll back.
* Enforce, in order: US federal speech laws that can get Twitch in legal
  trouble (Twitch is a US company), Twitch ToS and Community Guidelines,
  channel rules set by the streamer (written down or not), then use common
  sense.
* Ban anyone for making death threats, SWATting threats, rape threats, etc.
  and report to Twitch.  Click on their name, drag the pop-up window a bit
  to the left, and you'll see three dots.  Click that, and you can report
  the user.
* When chat gets too fast *during a spam attack*, turn on /slow and
  /uniquechat to purge/timeout/ban.  Enable 1 minute (or more)
  followers-only mode via /followers 1.
* Make a new Twitch account that does not follow or subscribe to any
  channels.  Use that for testing on your own channel to learn how to use
  commands.
* Don't argue with the streamer.
* If someone asks for an unban and *you* are the one that banned them,
  you can unban based on your judgment.  If you aren't the one that
  banned them, ask the streamer whether the person should be unbanned, or
  tell the user to ask the streamer directly via whispers, Twitter DM, etc.
* You can unmod yourself with /unmod yourusername

6. Intermediate mod stuff:
* Unignore everyone.  Trolls that you ignore are ones you can't time out or
  ban.  Use:
    https://twitchstuff.3v.fi/ignored/
  to find out who you've ignored.
* If you are getting too many whispers, you can go to
  https://www.twitch.tv/settings/security and enable "Block Whispers from
  Strangers".  You will only get a whisper from someone you follow.  Note,
  this does mean you will miss important messages, as well.  Consider the
  downsides before enabling this.
* Mods generally have access to the streamer's automod dashboard.  Use that
  dashboard to modify permitted and denied phrases to deal with common spam
  and terms.  Sorry, no regex support.  You can access it via two ways:
** https://www.twitch.tv/<streamername>/dashboard/settings/automod
** Click the gear icon below chat and click "Manage Moderation Settings"
* You can click on the user's name for a modal window that gives you the
  option to read the user's chat, timeout, and ban history.  You can find
  out who banned the user (if they're banned) and leave comments tied to
  that user in that particular channel with the "Mod comments" option.
* If a user isn't in chat, you can still get the moderation history for
  the user with /user <username>
* Read this Twitch help article, keep it bookmarked and on your bookmark
  bar for the browser, in case you have to deal with a viewer that is at
  risk of self-harm:

7. Tips and tricks
* Pause/resume the video to reset latency without nuking chat.
* Popped out videos will continue to see the stream even after a /host
* The chat user list is delayed on update, so don't rely on it for seeing
  if someone is in the chat.
* Collapsing the chat window will remove the user from the list, but they
  can still be watching and listening to the stream.
* Going to just the chat is possible by appending "/chat" to the channel URL.
* Don't accept friend requests you don't recognize.  They may be accounts
  trolls use to track you (yes, it happens).
* For two streams, multitwitch.tv works fine.  For 3 or more, direct users
  to multistre.am instead.
